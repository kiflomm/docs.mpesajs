# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some common questions and answers about using the mpesajs library.

## General Questions

### What is mpesajs?
mpesajs is a Node.js library that provides a simple and intuitive way to integrate with the Ethiopian M-Pesa API. It handles authentication, rate limiting, and provides type-safe interfaces for various M-Pesa operations.

### Which Node.js versions are supported?
mpesajs supports Node.js versions 14 and above. We recommend using the latest LTS version for optimal performance and security.

### Is mpesajs compatible with TypeScript?
Yes! mpesajs is written in TypeScript and includes built-in type definitions. You'll get full IntelliSense support in your IDE.

## Setup & Configuration

### How do I install mpesajs?
You can install mpesajs using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install mpesajs
# or
yarn add mpesajs
```

### How do I set up environment variables?
Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your M-Pesa credentials:

```env
MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
MPESA_SANDBOX=true
```

### Can I use mpesajs in the browser?
No, mpesajs is designed for server-side use only. Your M-Pesa credentials should never be exposed in client-side code.

## Authentication

### How long do access tokens last?
Access tokens are valid for 1 hour (3600 seconds). The library automatically handles token refresh.

### What happens if authentication fails?
The library will throw an `AuthenticationError` with details about what went wrong. Always implement proper error handling.

### Should I store the access token?
No need! The library handles token management internally with built-in caching and refresh mechanisms.

## API Operations

### What types of payments are supported?
mpesajs currently supports:
- Business-to-Customer (B2C) payments
- URL registration for callbacks
- More payment types coming soon!

### How do I handle callbacks from M-Pesa?
1. Register your callback URLs using the `RegisterUrl` class
2. Set up endpoints at your callback URLs
3. Validate the incoming requests
4. Send appropriate responses

### What's the difference between sandbox and production modes?
- Sandbox: Test environment with fake money
- Production: Real environment with actual transactions
- Switch between them using the `MPESA_SANDBOX` environment variable

## Error Handling

### What types of errors should I handle?
Main error types include:
- `ValidationError`: Invalid input parameters
- `AuthenticationError`: Authentication issues
- `PayoutError`: B2C payment failures
- `RegisterUrlError`: URL registration problems
- `NetworkError`: Connection issues

### How should I implement error handling?
Always use try-catch blocks and handle specific error types:

```typescript
try {
    const result = await payout.send(amount, remarks);
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
        // Handle validation errors
    } else if (error instanceof PayoutError) {
        // Handle payout errors
    } else {
        // Handle other errors
    }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

### Does mpesajs handle rate limiting?
Yes! The library includes built-in rate limiting to prevent API throttling.

### Can I configure rate limiting?
The rate limiting is pre-configured based on M-Pesa's API limits. This helps prevent account blocks and ensures reliable operation.

## Security

### How should I secure my credentials?
1. Always use environment variables
2. Never commit credentials to version control
3. Use different credentials for sandbox and production
4. Implement proper access controls

### Are HTTPS URLs required?
Yes, all callback URLs must use HTTPS. The library enforces this requirement to ensure secure communications.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Invalid phone number format"
Ensure phone numbers:
- Start with "251"
- Are 12 digits long
- Don't include spaces or special characters

#### "URL must use HTTPS"
All callback URLs must:
- Start with "https://"
- Be publicly accessible
- Have valid SSL certificates

#### "Rate limit exceeded"
The library implements rate limiting to protect your account. If you're hitting limits:
- Implement proper error handling
- Add retries with exponential backoff
- Contact M-Pesa support if you need higher limits
